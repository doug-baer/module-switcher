#hol-module-switcher

A PowerShell-based panel used to launch module start/stop scripts for demonstration and training environments.

See the README-HOL-ModuleSwitcher.pdf for detailed description. 

TL;DR - This creates a timple "manel" with start/stop buttons that can be used to call PowerShell scripts easily

We have used this in the Hands-on Labs on our Windows desktop machines to facilitate "fast-forward" capability within lab environments.
